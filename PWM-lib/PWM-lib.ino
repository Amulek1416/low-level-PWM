 * @brief   File for testing and debugging components 
 *          of the library. If everything in this file
 *          works on the board, then the board has been
 *          fully supported.
 * 
 * @warning This is still a working progress. Once the 
 *          first board (Arduino Uno) is fully implemented, 
 *          there will be more testing functions created. 
 *          Right now this is just used to make sure it 
 *          compiles and there are no syntax errors.

# low-level-PWM
A fully customizable PWM library for arduino

This library was originally going to be a part of another project to just control some PWM signals at a low level. It eventually started become complicated enough to where a serperate repository was needed.

THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND THE MASTER BRANCH ISN'T A FUNCTIONAL LIBRARY
